# Advanced SQL Project With Window Functions

This project is designed to showcase real-world SQL skills, starting from table creation, data insertion, basic SQL functions, and progressing towards advanced Window Functions.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered:

- Create Table & Insert Data
- String Functions (SUBSTRING, EXTRACT, TO_CHAR)
- CASE WHEN Statements
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Group By and Having Clauses
- Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Analytical Calculations Using OVER(), PARTITION BY, ORDER BY

---

## 🗂 Tables Created:

- **Departments**  
- **Employees**

Each table is populated with sample realistic data to simulate real-world business scenarios.

---

## ❓ Problem Statements:

A set of 20 carefully designed SQL questions, ranging from basic queries to complex analytical queries involving Window Functions.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used:

- SQL (PostgreSQL flavor preferred, but queries are mostly standard)

---

## 🚀 How to Run:

1. Open your GitHub repository.
2. Create a new `.sql` file (e.g., `sql_queries.sql`).
3. Copy-paste the code (from the given SQL queries) directly into the file.
4. Execute the queries step-by-step in your local SQL environment.
5. Understand the logic behind each question and answer.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes:

- Understand how to manipulate strings and dates in SQL.
- Learn how to use CASE statements for conditional logic.
- Master the use of Window Functions for complex analytics.
- Apply SQL skills to real-world business scenarios.
